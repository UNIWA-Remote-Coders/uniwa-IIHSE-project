iPhone, forged from titanium<br>

The iPhone 15 Pro Max is the first iPhone to feature a titanium aerospace-grade design, using the same alloy used by spaceships for missions to Mars.<br>


Titanium has one of the best strength-to-weight ratios of any metal, making these Pro models the lightest ever. You will notice the difference from the moment you get one of these.<br>


The beautiful, slim brushed finish on the titanium bands is achieved through precision processing, polishing, brushing, and sandblasting.<br>


The new contoured edges and slimmest margins ever on the iPhone make it even more comfortable to hold in your hand.<br>


The titanium band is connected to a new internal aluminum frame through solid-state diffusion. This is a groundbreaking innovation in the industry, using a thermomechanical process that joins these two metals with incredible strength.

The internal frame is also made from 100% recycled aluminum, which contributes to overall use of recycled materials and helps us achieve our climate goals for 2030.
