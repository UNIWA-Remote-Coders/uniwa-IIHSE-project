The world's first quad-curved foldable smartphone, a future-forward design that ushers in a revolutionary form factor. As sturdy as it is, the phone's four edges are soft-rounded for comfortable handling, enhancing an outstanding feel that lasts over time.<br>

Slimmed Down, Spruced Up<br>
HUAWEI Mate X3's slim and light foldable design takes full advantage of its new-gen multi-dimensional hinge, ensuring compactness when folded and ultra-thinness when unfolded. To further reduce weight, it uses an ultra-slim design around Type-C component, ultra light and strong aluminium and carbon fibre.<br>

Two Screens to Savour<br>

As the first foldable smartphone to garner two TÜV Rheinland certifications (Colour Accuracy & Precise Colour Projection)⁠, HUAWEI Mate X3 brings true-to-life details right in front of you, supporting 1.07 billion colours and groundbreaking HUAWEI X-True technology. Thanks to its Intelligent Light-Sensitive Display, the screens deliver a consistent viewing experience, whatever the occasion is. The interior screen's anti-reflection layer keeps the view clear, even under direct sunlight.<br>
