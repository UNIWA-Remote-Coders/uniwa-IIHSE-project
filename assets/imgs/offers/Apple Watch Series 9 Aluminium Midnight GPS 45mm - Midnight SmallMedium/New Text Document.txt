The Apple Watch Series 9 is more powerful than ever with the new S9 SiP, which enhances performance and capabilities, a new magical double-tap gesture, a brighter display, faster Siri on the device, now with the ability to access and record health data, precise finding for iPhone, and much more.<br>

The Apple Watch Series 9 runs watchOS 10, which offers redesigned apps, the new Smart Stack, new watch faces, new cycling and hiking features, and tools to support mental health.<br>
S9 SiP<br>
The custom silicon of Apple makes the Apple Watch Series 9 more capable, intuitive, and faster. The new dual-core CPU features 5.6 billion transistors - 60 percent more than the S8 chip. A new quad-core Neural Engine processes machine learning tasks up to two times faster.<br>

It enables a range of innovations, including a new gesture - double tap.<br>

Double Tap<br>
Gestures make the Apple Watch even easier to use at any time, especially when your hands are full. Simply double tap your index finger and thumb together to answer a call, open a notification, play and pause music, and much more.<br>

2x brighter display<br>
The advanced display system of the Series 9 increases the maximum brightness to 2000 nits - double that of the Series 8 - for easier reading in full sunlight conditions. It is also better in low-light conditions, such as in cinemas, as it dims to just 1 nit.<br>

Siri<br>
With Series 9, the Siri requests processed by your device are faster and more secure. In addition, Siri dictation is up to 25 percent more accurate. And later this year, you'll be able to ask Siri about your health data, such as how much sleep you got last night. Or use it to track information like your weight or menstrual cycle.
