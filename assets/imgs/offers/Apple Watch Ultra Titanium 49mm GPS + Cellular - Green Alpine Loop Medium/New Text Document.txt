The most durable and capable Apple Watch exceeds the limits once again. It features the brand new S9 SiP. A magical new way to use your watch without touching the screen. The brightest display ever from Apple. Now you can choose a case and strap combination that is carbon-neutral.<br>


The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is designed for unparalleled performance. The lightweight titanium case is sturdy and resistant to corrosion, and it is raised to protect the sapphire crystal from impacts on the edges.<br>


The largest and brightest display Apple Watch
With the support of the brand new S9 SiP, the Always-On Retina display has 3000 nits at its peak, making it even more readable in bright sunlight.<br>


In low-light conditions, it reduces to 1 nit. Night mode is now automatically activated in the dark. The large display gives you space to customize your view to fit almost any activity. And a new watch face displays dynamic information like altitude, depth, or seconds.<br>
