Conquer every hour of the day with advanced workout features, 24/7 health and wellness monitoring, and over a month of battery life with the Power Sapphire solar charging lens, all combined in a durable watch frame designed for smaller wrists.<br>
You have up to 14 days of operation on a smartwatch with 3 hours of solar charging in direct sunlight (50,000 lux) per day, and up to 46 hours of operation with GPS and solar charging (requires continuous use for the entire period under 50,000 lux conditions).<br>
Variable lens intensities and a red safety light provide you with greater awareness while training in the dark, giving you sufficient illumination when you need it. The lens flashing function can even match your running pace.
