Descriptions:<br>
Without noise, cables, and distractions. Only exceptional sound, top noise cancellation, and countless hours of absolute audio freedom.<br><br>

Top noise cancellation feature<br>
The noise cancellation technology in the WF-1000XM3 headphones is Sony's most advanced in truly wireless headphones, thanks to Sony's HD QN1e noise cancellation processor.<br><br>

All-day battery life<br>
The full charge offers 6 hours of power and the charging case provides 3 additional charges for all-day operation. With noise cancellation disabled, it lasts even longer, with 8 hours of power with full charge, plus the 3 charges from the charging case, for up to 32 hours of playback. Also, with a quick 10-minute charge in the magnetic charging case, you can enjoy up to 90 minutes of playback time.<br><br>

Hands-free calls with clearer sound<br>
Speak freely, with easy hands-free calls. The WF-1000XM3 headphones offer higher voice clarity, and you can answer calls using either one or both earbuds. This way, you can charge them alternately or listen to calls clearly in noisy environments.
