Poco X5 5G<br><br>
Redefining the idea of what a mid-range smartphone is, the Poco X5 5G has everything the generation of Genzers need throughout their day for work, reading, and fun. Even when taking thousands of photos, playing games for hours, or watching high-quality videos, the device has every need covered.<br>



Screen AMOLED<br>
Ultra-light and slim, with an AMOLED DotDisplay at 6.67 inches, and weighing just 189 grams, the Poco X5 5G is comfortable at all times. Gaming fans will appreciate the screen's 120Hz refresh rate as well as the 4,500,000:1 contrast ratio that guarantees a smooth, true gaming experience, while the DCI-P3 wide colour gamut offers vivid images.<br>


Snapdragon 695<br>
The Poco X5 5G comes with the Snapdragon 695 processor that provides a seamless user experience for high speeds and performance, as well as high download speeds. The device offers the perfect combination of RAM and ROM to keep content smooth and enjoyable. Users "running" multiple modes at the same time can switch from one application to another thanks to Dynamic RAM Expansion Technology 3.0 that allows more applications to remain active in the background.<br>


Play for... hours!<br>
Thanks to the 5000mAh battery you can go from work to gaming, listening to content, surfing social media without a problem. No need to stress about low battery, the moment you can watch YouTube videos for 21 hours.<br>

The device's 33W charger can fully charge the device in just 68 minutes, which is as long as it takes a lunch break before you resume gaming or the latest episode of your favourite show. A fully charged device gives you up to 12 hours of surfing and social media interaction.<br>
